http://localhost:8765/currency-conversion/currency-conversion-feign/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10

can reduce like it using routes
http://localhost:8765/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR
http://localhost:8765/currency-conversion/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10
http://localhost:8765/currency-conversion-feign/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10

instead of currency-conversion-feign, I would want to actually call this something else
and i want to redirect to feign
http://localhost:8765/currency-conversion-new/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10
